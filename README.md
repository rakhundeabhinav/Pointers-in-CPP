# 🔹 Experiment 9 – Pointers in C++

## 🎯 **Aim**

To understand and implement pointer operations in C++ including pointer difference, pointer increment, and string reversal using pointers.

## 📚 **Theory**

Pointers are variables that store the memory address of another variable. They are powerful tools in C++ that allow direct memory manipulation, efficient array handling, and flexible function arguments. Pointer arithmetic can be used to perform operations like incrementing addresses, finding differences between pointers, and traversing data structures.

## 📜 **Programs**

### 1️⃣ Pointer Difference

**📝 Description:**

This program calculates the difference between two pointers to determine the number of elements between them in an array.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Declare an array and two pointer variables.
2. Assign pointers to different positions in the array.
3. Subtract one pointer from the other.
4. Display the difference.

---

### 2️⃣ Pointer Increment

**📝 Description:**

This program demonstrates incrementing a pointer to traverse and display array elements.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Declare an array and a pointer variable.
2. Initialize the pointer to point to the first element of the array.
3. Increment the pointer in a loop to access each element.
4. Display the elements.

### 3️⃣ Reverse String using Pointers

**📝 Description:**

This program takes a string as input and reverses it using pointer manipulation without using standard functions like `getline()`.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Take string input from the user.
2. Set one pointer at the start and another at the end of the string.
3. Swap the characters at both pointers and move them towards each other.
4. Continue until the pointers meet.
5. Display the reversed string.

## ✅ **Conclusion**

Through this experiment, we learned the fundamentals of pointer arithmetic, including difference and increment operations, as well as practical string manipulation using pointers.
