# 🔹 Experiment 9 – Pointers in C++

## 🎯 **Aim**

To understand and implement pointer operations in C++ including pointer difference, pointer increment, array traversal, and string reversal using pointers.

## 📚 **Theory**

Pointers in C++ store the memory address of another variable, enabling direct memory access and manipulation. Pointer arithmetic allows operations such as incrementing pointers, finding pointer differences, and traversing data structures efficiently. They are especially useful for handling arrays, dynamic memory, and optimizing performance in programs.

## 📜 **Programs**

### 1️⃣ Pointer Difference 🔹

**📝 Description:**

Calculates the number of elements between two pointers in an array.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Declare an array and two pointer variables.
2. Assign pointers to different positions in the array.
3. Subtract one pointer from the other.
4. Display the difference.

---

### 2️⃣ Pointer Increment 🔹

**📝 Description:**

Demonstrates incrementing a pointer to traverse and display array elements.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Declare an array and a pointer variable.
2. Initialize the pointer to the first element of the array.
3. Increment the pointer in a loop to access each element.
4. Display the elements.

---

### 3️⃣ Traversing Array using Pointers 🔹

**📝 Description:**

Uses a pointer to sequentially access and display elements of an array without using the subscript operator.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Declare an array and a pointer.
2. Assign the pointer to the first element of the array.
3. Loop through the array using the pointer.
4. Increment the pointer after each element.
5. Display all array elements.

---

### 4️⃣ Reverse String using Pointers 🔹

**📝 Description:**

Reverses a string using pointer manipulation without standard functions like `getline()`.

**⚙️ Algorithm:**

1. Take string input from the user.
2. Set one pointer at the start and another at the end of the string.
3. Swap the characters at both pointers.
4. Move pointers towards each other until they meet.
5. Display the reversed string.

## ✅ **Conclusion**

Through this experiment, we learned how to perform pointer arithmetic including difference, increment, array traversal, and string reversal using pointers, improving our understanding of memory-level operations in C++.
